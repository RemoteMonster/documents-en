# Error Code

## Overview

The *RemoteMonster* APIs have two major exceptions: *Fail* and *Error*.

### Fail

*Fail* refers to an exception that mainly occurs during communication.
*Fail* occurs when the communication connection is not established, when
the connection is disconnected, or when the connection is unstable. You
can receive Fail events with the `onStateChange` callback method.

### Error

*Error* refers to an exception in a broader area, including *Fail*. You
will receive an Error code through the `onError` callback method.

#### InvalidParameterError

* When a parameter given for `new Remon` is invalid
  * If there is no *Key, Service Id, Local View, Remote View*, or if there is no `config` or *Callback*, or if the parameter is too long
* An incorrect value is given at connectChannel (if the length is less than 1 or too long(100 or more))
* `UnsupportedPlatformError`
  * If the Browser does not support
  * If the Version does not support

#### InitFailedError

#### ConnectChannelFailedError
