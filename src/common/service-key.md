Service Key
===========

Overview
--------

In order to use *RemoteMonster* effectively, you need to acquire your
*Service ID* and *Key* to access *RemoteMonster*. *Service ID* and *Key*
are used to distinguish each user, and they can be issued separately for
each independent service. At the same time, they become the basis for
measurement of usage and billing.
