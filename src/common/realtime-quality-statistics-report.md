# Realtime Quality Statistics Report

## Overview

During a video and voice call, you can check its current quality in levels from 1 to 5.

Users sometimes complain about their service problems even if the call quality is poor or disconnected because of their network problems. Therefore, it is possible to inform users of their network problems in advance or to handle various UIs.

Currently, this call quality data can be received once every 5 seconds.

| levels | Quality | Remarks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Very Good |  |
| 2 | Good |  |
| 3 | Poor |  |
| 4 | Very Poor |  |
| 5 | Broadcast/call disabled |  |

## Usage

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Web" %}
```javascript
const listener = {
  onStat(result){
    const stat = `State: l.cand: ${result.localCandidate} /r.cand: ${result.remoteCandidate} /l.res: ${result.localFrameWidth} x ${result.localFrameHeight} /r.res: ${result.remoteFrameWidth} ${result.remoteFrameHeight} /l.rate: ${result.localFrameRate} /r.rate: ${result.remoteFrameRate} / Health: ${result.rating}`
    console.log(stat)
  }
}
```

You can get the quality data by implementing `onStat()`_,_ one of the methods of _listener,_ which you input as an input argument when you create a `Remon` object. The `result.rating` data obtained from the above `result` is the integrated call quality information according to the network situation.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Android" %}
```java
  @Override
  public void onStatReport(RemonStatReport report) {
      Logger.i(TAG, "report: " + report.getHealthRating());
      String stat = "health:" + report.getHealthRating().getLevel() + "\n";
  }
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Swift" %}
```swift
let remonCall = RemonCall()
remoCall.onRemonStatReport{ (stat) in 
    let rating = stat.getRttRating()
    // Do something
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Objc" %}
```objectivec
[self.remonCast onRemonStatReportWithBlock:^(RemonStatReport * _Nonnull stat) {
    RatingValue *rating = [stat getRttRating];
    // Do something
}];
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
