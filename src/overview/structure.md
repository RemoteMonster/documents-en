# Structure

## Overview

It is very simple to use *RemoteMonster\'s SDK*. You only need to learn how to use three classes.

## Remon class

`Remon` performs all broadcasting and communication operations. This `Remon` class is used in all the processes of initializing broadcasting, communication status, opening a room, connecting to a room, and terminating the service. It also performs additional functions such as sending a message.

To create the `Remon` class, there should be two following prerequisites. `Config` and `Observer`.

### Init

This is used for initializing an object. This connects to the *RemoteMonster API* server. At the moment of connection, the *RemoteMonster* server provides a disposable token for this `Remon` object.

### Create, Join

This function is used for broadcasting. This is a command to create or watch a broadcast. When creating a broadcast, the `Observer` callback receives the actual unique *id* of the broadcast from `onCreate`. With this *id* value, viewers can access the broadcast through the `Join` method.

### Connect

This function is used for communication. This is a command to connect to a channel or create a channel. It creates a channel if there is no channel with the given name, and it connects to the channel if it already exists. If there is no channel name, *RemoteMonster* generates and returns a unique channel name.

### Close

Exit the room or destroy the room and do initialization.

## Config Class

All necessary pre-configuration tasks are done through this `Config` before initializing the `Remon` object. It is used to handle a variety of tasks related to the authentication information (`Service Id`, and `Key`), media and network. Please refer to the following for the details.

Observer Class
--------------

`Observer` is a class for receiving `Callback` messages if the *Remon* class is intended to issue commands. By using events received from the `Observer`, more detailed communication effects and active services can be implemented. Please refer to the following for the details.
